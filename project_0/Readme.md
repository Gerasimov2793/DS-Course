# What kind of project we are solving
We have to write a prorgamm guesses number for a minimun amount of trials

**Rules for the problem solving:**
- The computer guesses an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. by "guess" we mean "write" a program that guesses the number.
- The algorithm takes into account the information about whether a random number is larger or smaller than the one we want.

# Quality metric
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1,000 repetitions

**That we practice**
learning to write good looking code in python
